# PHYS-643-Assignment-3-Question-1.3
The code used for the numerical methods question at McGill's PHYS 643 Astrophysical Fluids class, Assignment 3 Question 1.3.

I collaborated with Numa Karolinski, but each of us wrote our own code. 

Note that in order to run this code properly, you must have the python module tk downloaded. To download it, use the command "sudo apt-get install python3-tk"
